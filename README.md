<h2>Why would i use this?</h2>
If you are tired of create a big codes and stay think in how to create yours popup messages, we have a solution for your project

<h2>Ok, i want test this</h2>
Right, the first step is add this lib a your dependency and configure your project:

<b>Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:</b>

allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
  
<b>Step 2. Add the dependency</b>

dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.michel566:Light-Dialog:Tag'
}


You need change this ":Tag" for the current version of this lib
And, yes. I copy this explaination of the Jitpack... :)
